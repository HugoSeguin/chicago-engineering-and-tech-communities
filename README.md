# Chicago Engineering and Tech Communities and Organizations

Inspired by [This Dot's Tech Community Slacks](https://github.com/thisdot/tech-community-slacks) but Chicago focused! A consolidated list of Chicago Engineering Communities and organizations. Please add any that you think are missing! Please note that any added should be engineering/tech focused and in Chicago, or at least have a substantial Chicago subcommunity. For Meetups, they should have in person Chicago events, rather than just being only online events with a "Chicago" chapter which exists to get in search listings. There is a great calendar of Chicago-based events one can find at [Chicago Tech Community Events](https://chitechcommunityevents.softr.app/).

## [Hackerspaces](https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/Chicago)
  Hackerspaces (also hacklabs, hackspaces) are community-operated physical places, where people share their interest in tinkering with technology, meet and work on their projects, and learn from each other.

-	[Analytics Lounge](https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/Analytics_Lounge)
-	[Artifice](https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/Artifice)
-	[Catalyze](https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/Catalyze)

-	[South Side Hackerspace](https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/South_Side_Hackerspace)
    
## Universities
 Universities are the core of many engineering studies around the world that are central to any community. However, generally they are not directly open to the public at large to engage with.
-	[DePaul University](https://www.depaul.edu/Pages/default.aspx)
-	[Illinois Institute of Technology - Armour College of Engineering](https://www.iit.edu/engineering)
-	[Northwestern University - McCormick School of Engineering](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/)
-	[UIC (University of Illinois Chicago)](https://engineering.uic.edu/)
-	[University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/education-and-research/academic-programs)


## Other
 For other groups that are not directly engineering related, but I feel are worth bringing to the attention of engineers in Chicago.
-	[Chicago Associate Boards](https://www.chicagogrouptravel.com/post/chicago-young-professionals-volunteer-and-make-new-friends) - This is a great list of various associate boards in Chicago athat young professional can join to start getting board leadership experience, and volunteering in their community.
-	[Awesome Discord Communities](https://github.com/mhxion/awesome-discord-communities/) = Not specifically Chicago, but I feel that there is a great benefit to the numerous Engineering and Tech discord communities out there for anyone to be part of to learn from others.
