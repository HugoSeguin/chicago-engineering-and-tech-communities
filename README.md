# Chicago Engineering and Tech Communities and Organizations

Inspired by [This Dot's Tech Community Slacks](https://github.com/thisdot/tech-community-slacks) but Chicago-focused! (However the [Awesome Tech Communities fork](https://github.com/MartinRosenberg/Awesome-Tech-Communities) is far more active and up to date than Dot's) A consolidated list of Chicago Engineering Communities and organizations. Please add any that you think are missing! Please note that any added should be engineering/tech-focused and in Chicago, or at least have a substantial Chicago subcommunity. For Meetups, they should have in-person Chicago events, rather than just being only online events with a "Chicago" chapter which exists to get in search listings. There is a great calendar of Chicago-based events one can find at [Chicago Tech Community Events](https://chitechcommunityevents.softr.app/).

## Online Chicago Communities

While the strong preference and focus of this page is to focus on in-person meetups, there is a place for slacks/discords/other of online groups focused in the Chicago region. To be in this section, there needs to be a specific focus on Chicago either on the entire commnunity, or at least a channel for Chicago. Many of these have requirements to join, e.g. you need to be invited, so you may need to attend an event in person first. 

#### Personal Favorites of @driscoll42

These are the ones that I (@driscoll42) enjoy the most, from a combination of amount of activity on the channels/apps and lack of spam. Some are less active than others on the list, but much of that "activity" can be a bit spammy. I admit that some of the others I just know less as it's an area that's not my focus so I encourage checking out all that interest you and make your own call.
