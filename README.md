# Chicago Engineering Communities and Organizations

Inspired by [This Dot's Tech Community Slacks](https://github.com/thisdot/tech-community-slacks) but Chicago focused! A consolidated list of Chicago Engineering Communities and organizations. Please add any that you think are missing! Please note that any added should be engineering/tech focused and in Chicago, or at least have a substantial Chicago subcommunity. For Meetups, they should have in person Chicago events, rather than just being only online events with a "Chicago" chapter which exists to get in search listings.
