To find jobs in Chicago, I *highly* recommend checking out Built In Chicago: https://www.builtinchicago.org/ Great resource for finding internships/jobs/etc...
Note: Built In Chicago is part of a larger network, so if you go to the site there's Built In Seattle, Built In San Francisco, and others, not just limited to Chicagoland
