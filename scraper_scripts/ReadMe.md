# Scraping Scripts

This directory contains scripts to scrape the various websites which host Chicago events. Each website has it's own .py scraping file which are run through the main.ipynb notebook.

The intent is to one day to use [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u90ixCz1_tTuIbF8wuYS5XrqsWTAMVTLP4WFZbq3WA0/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=105537620406903003948) as the "database" for the groups whose events to pull in and then update calendars/website/slack/discord with new events.

Currently it only pulls a small subset of sites, and work needs to be done to figure out all the various custom websites to get their events. Follow the Project for to do work.
